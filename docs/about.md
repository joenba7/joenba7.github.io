I'm Jorge, and this is my blog, **The Road to Elysium**, where I keep some of my thoughts, small bits of code, and various other things stored.
During the day I work as a Linux infrastructure engineer, and the rest of my time
is either spent on my wife, kids, and even technical things when time allows!
