Chromium is pretty great. It’s damn quick and I rather enjoy the interface. But for some reason the people developing it haven’t yet decided if they are going to implement the whole mark-an-url-and-press-the-scrollwheel-on-your-mouse-to-load-the-url. Phew, that’s a mouthful. Anyway, it has been annoying me like mad. Luckily, I found an extension at  which seems to do the trick. So have a look, enjoy, and let’s hope that the developers make up their mind.
