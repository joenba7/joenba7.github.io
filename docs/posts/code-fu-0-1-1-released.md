Seems the people over at the [GeSHi Headquarters](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) decided to release a new version of GeSHi, 1.0.8.4. So it was time for me to upgrade code-fu as well. You can as usual head over to the [Atlantis Crew download section](http://www.atlantiscrew.net/download.html) to grab it from there, and read more about code-fu at . A working up-to-date copy can always be found at .
