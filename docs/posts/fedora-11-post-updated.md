Hellooo.

Iâ€™ve now updated the post [Fedora 11 on the Acer Aspire One](http://jorge.fbarr.net/2009/06/11/fedora-11-on-the-acer-aspire-one/) with a new thing; **How to enable autologin**.

I will also be explaining how to properly format your USB-pen so that making a Live-USB is easier, and less troublesome. Head on over and have a look. :)
