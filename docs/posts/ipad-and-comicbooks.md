So what can I say. I finally succumbed and bought an iPad. Mainly because my friend Kevin kept nagging me about how wonderful it was. Bastard. Gríma Wormtongue is his new nickname. I’ve had my iPad for a couple of weeks now.

But seriously though, the iPad is doing great stuff for me. I’m using it for all sorts of purposes, and the one I’m going to bring up in this case is reading comicbooks. I use an application called [Comic Zeal](http://www.comiczealapp.com/). Now, I’ve never been a particularly avid reader of comicbooks, but I remember back during my younger years when I sat at the library, reading every edition of [Elfquest](http://www.elfquest.com/) that I could get my hands on. So years (yeaaaaars) later, I finally wanted to give it a try again. That’s where [Comic Zeal](http://www.comiczealapp.com/) comes into play.

[Comic Zeal](http://www.comiczealapp.com/) is an application able to (taken from their site):

- Organize your comics using Series and Dividers, don’t look through hundreds to find the one you want.
- Search and find your comics by title. On the iPad you can tag your comics for even easier searching.
- Use Comic Zeal‘s copy function to organize your collection in amazing ways.
- When you finish reading one comic, Comic Zeal automatically opens the next one.
- Avoid seeing the same borders page after page with Comic Zeal’s zoom lock.
- Load your comics through USB or wi-fi using iTunes file sharing, or other apps like Drop Box!

It really works great, I can truly recommend it.

Now, I’ve only come across a few good comicbooks so far, but the ones I can recommend are:

American Vampire
----------------

The series imagines vampires as a population made up of many different secret species, and charts moments of vampire evolution and inter-species conflict throughout history. The focus of the series is a new American bloodline of vampires, born in the American West in the late 1800s. The first of this new species is a notorious outlaw named Skinner Sweet, who wakes from death, after being infected, to find he has become a new kind of vampire, something stronger and faster than what came before, impervious to sunlight, with a new set of strengths and weaknesses.

The Walking Dead
----------------

The Walking Dead is a monthly black-and-white comic book series chronicling the travels of Rick Grimes, his family, and other survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Shot in the line of duty, Kentucky police officer Rick Grimes wakes from a coma in the hospital to find his town filled with walking corpses.

Witch Doctor
------------

Witch Doctor combines elements of the horror and medical drama genres. The protagonist, Dr. Vincent Morrow, is a maverick doctor who specializes in “supernatural medicine,” supplementing common medical practices with magic. Dr. Morrow’s “cases” predominantly involve infectious supernatural creatures like vampires, demonic possession, as well as elements based on the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft. In the first Witch Doctor mini-series, Dr. Morrow treats (and battles) a vampire, demons possessing a child, faerie changelings, and Deep Ones (crossed with the Creature From the Black Lagoon), among others.

So there you have it! If you have any other suggestions (I’ve been recommended Sandman, Fable and Y: The Last Man so far), let me know!
