[GNU (GNU’s Not Unix)](http://www.gnu.org) celebrated quite recently (yesterday) a very special birthday. 25 years had passed since everything was started, and even [Stephen Fry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry) was eager to make a video, congratulating the project.

As I may have mentioned before (or not at all), I used to be a GNU webmaster, helping them translate their website to Norwegian. I don’t recall how long I helped out, perhaps a year. I had to give it up though, real life came in the way. With Michael around now, I’m surprised I even have time to check my email when at home. Having left the days with GNU behind me, imagine my surprise when a co-worker made me aware of this:

Seems my name was in the end credits. :) There you have it, my 1.5 seconds of fame. :)

Oh, and happy birthday GNU!
