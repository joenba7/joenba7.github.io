I’ve intentionally been waiting to write this post, as I’ve not been so sure of what to write. I guess it all depended on the outcome of my RHCE-exam that I had yesterday. The results? Well, see for yourself.

I just can’t believe that I aced the test! 100% correct, god! I have to tell you, I never ever thought this was possible, but the countless hours I spent studying and practicing for the test was well worth it. :)


I’ll be posting some tips and tricks concerning the RHCE-exam soon, so stay tuned.
