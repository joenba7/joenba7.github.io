I have an Apple TV 2 that I’ve installed **XBMC** on. For a while it was working great, but out of the blue suddenly the sound got choppy. I guess there was an update that changed something. The best description I have for it is that the audio sounded like a machine gun – very annoying! And made movies unwatchable. Luckily, there’s a way to fix this. You simply need to change some of the **XBMC**-settings.

Go to:

- **System**
- **System**
- **Audio output**
- Check/uncheck **Dolby Digital AC3** and **DTS as capable receivers**

This should do the trick! It certainly worked for me, so sure hope it works for you.

Continue enjoying your movies and series!
