This post never gets old. I constantly keep finding new and useful addons for Firefox. Here’s the list of what I consider to be some of the best Firefox addons out there.

- [Adblock Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865)
  - Ever been annoyed by all those ads and banners on the internet that often take longer to download than everything else on the page? Install Adblock Plus now and get rid of them.
- [MediaplayerConnectivity](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/446)
  - Allow you to launch embed video of website in an external application with a simple click.
- [StartupMaster](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9808)
  - Asks for the master password at startup (fixes multiple password prompt).
- [Tab Mix Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122)
  - Tab Mix Plus enhances Firefox’s tab browsing capabilities. It includes such features as duplicating tabs, controlling tab focus, tab clicking options, undo closed tabs and windows, plus much more. It also includes a full-featured session manager.
- [Tiny Menu](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1455)
  - Replace the standard menu bar with a tiny menu popup.
- [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5890)
  - Show tabs like a tree.
- [Xmarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2410)
  - Xmarks is the #1 bookmarking add-on. Install it on all your computers to keep your bookmarks and (optionally) passwords backed up and synchronized. Xmarks also helps you uncover the best of the web based on what millions of people are bookmarking.
- [It’s all Text!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125/)
  - Right click on a text area, select “It’s All Text!” and edit the text in the editor of your choice.
- [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60)
  - The Web Developer extension adds a menu and a toolbar with various web developer tools.
- [BarTab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/67651/)
  - BarTab can intercept when tabs are loaded in the background or restored after a browser restart and will only load the content when the tab is actually visited. It also allows you to free memory by unloading already loaded tabs, either manually or automatically.
