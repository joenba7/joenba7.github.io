June 30th 2009 [I wrote about an equalizer-plugin for Rhythmbox](http://jorge.fbarr.net/2010/02/18/rhythmbox-equalizer/) which then was just about the only decent thing available. It now seems that that plugin isnâ€™t being worked on anymore. Luckily we have people like Christopher Kruse from . :) He has now released version 1.3 of his Rhythmbox equalizer-plugin, which you can find at .

The installation:

```
wget http://rbeq.googlecode.com/files/rbeq-1.3.tar.gz
tar -zxvf rbeq-1.3.tar.gz -C ~/.gnome2/
```

Head on over to  for the main post. Thanks Christopher!

And of course, a screenshot of the plugin:
